The problem is that in real-world situations, we don't know what the sample mean is, so we have to turn to using the sample mean to estimate the population mean. Because the sample mean is generated from a sample and used to estimate the population mean with some level of uncertainty, it also has its own distribution a nd spread. This means that for low sample sizes both our estimates of the sample mean and sample population are not very precise, they're kind of spread out. It's this spread that makes the t-distribution wider than the normal distribution for low sample sizes.
